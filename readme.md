# A definitely not a NodeJS-based web server framework

## Why?

I wanna have the power of C++ on my server apps, but I could not find any server library or framework that would fit my workflow and code style. Deno is very close to be a perfect fit, but it's a JavaScript runtime so good luck have fun making it work with windows-specific APIs, some socially awkward devices or cryptic AF DLLs from 1995... I mean, just the usual stuff I work with.

Does it sound like a deal? It does to me.

## Why is lambda cool?

Code style. This is all that takes to create a web server:

```cpp
#include "lambda.hpp"
#include <cstdio>

using namespace Lambda;

HTTP::Response callbackServerless(HTTP::Request& request, Context& context) {

  auto uaString = request.headers.get("user-agent");

  auto response = HTTP::Response();
  response.setText(std::string("Your user-agent is: ") + (uaString.size() ? uaString : "Unknown"));

  return response;
};

int main() {

  const int port = 8080;
  auto server = Lambda::Server(port);
  server.setServerlessCallback(&callbackServerless);

  puts(("Server started at http://localhost:" + std::to_string(port)).c_str());

  while (server.isAlive()) {
    
    if (server.hasNewLogs()) {
      puts(HTTP::stringJoin(server.logsText(), "\n").c_str());
    }

    std::this_thread::sleep_for(std::chrono::milliseconds(10));
  }
  
  return 0;
}

```

**Here, a Vue project is being served by lambda for no reason at all**

Please note that lambda is not an "nginx killer", so you probably don’t wanna use it for high bandwidth loads (some sort of CDN or alike). It’s meant to be used as a middleman between the stuff that does not work with modern web APIs and the stuff that does.

## JSON

You might not like my JSON implementation (I had a reason to put it here), so you might want to try [JSON for Modern C++ ](https://github.com/nlohmann/json) as a replacement. My implementation will still be used under the hood where performance is desirable.

## Error handling/exceptions

By default, lambda utilizes std::exception and its derived classes for where no additional error codes are present. In the presence of error codes (like winapi error or errno), or if the error is not thrown but is returned by a function the Lambda::Error shall be used. Lambda::Error is derived from std::exception base class an can be caught as one.

The reason for that is simple: to not have different functions return different error objects. And the name “exception” just does not sound right for an object that may be returned by a function.


## Building a server app with lambda

### Requirements

1. GCC 10+ and autotools or just GCC 10+ and make (any version really)
2. Get `deps/` submodules downloaded too
3. NodeJS if you want to change autogenerated makefiles and resources

On windows you can get the compiler from [msys2](https://packages.msys2.org/package/)

Oh and yes, Visual Studio can go touch grass itself.

### Compiling library

If the mix of nodejs and python for generating secondary source files scares you, it really shouldn't, the resulting files are included in this repo, you don’t have to think about it at all. I just can't decide which one to use.

`make` command will produce `liblambda.dll.a` and `lambda.dll`. Never it was simpler than that.

Don't forget to add `-lws2_32` on Windows or it will bite you in the ass.

### Compiling your project

Link `lambda.dll` and you're good to go. Oh, don't forget to include some headers, obviously.

Go see [some examples or smthng](/examples)


## A few quick notes before you start blasting

### OS support

- Any modern linux
- Windows 7+ (might actually work on 7, let me know if it does)

### Compiler version

Use GCC 10 or never. The project uses a few of the c++20 features, and it might not compile with GCC's older versions.

Other compilers are not \*officially\* supported, but there aren't any super-GCC-specific tricks employed in this project, so theoretically with some tweaking it should compile anywhere.

## Sample project architecture

**For those, who scrolled all the way here, here is a diagram of the project lambda was created for:**
