# A definitely not a NodeJS-based web server framework

## Why?

I wanna have the power of C++ on my server apps, but I could not find any server library or framework that would fit my workflow and code style. Deno is very close to be a perfect fit, but it's a JavaScript runtime so good luck have fun making it work with windows-specific APIs, some socially awkward devices or cryptic AF DLLs from 1995... I mean, just the usual stuff I work with.

Does it sound like a deal? It does to me.

## Why lambda?

It was very similar to AWS lambda before 1.0, that's why the name. I didn't spend a second thinking of it. A true engineer move, let the marketing department fix it later.

**Here, a Vue project is being served by lambda for no reason at all**

## JSON

You might not like my JSON implementation (I had a reason to put it here), so you might want to try [JSON for Modern C++ ](https://github.com/nlohmann/json) as a replacement. My implementation will still be used under the hood where performance is desirable.

## Building a server app with lambda

### Requirements

1. GCC 10+ and autotools or just GCC 10+ and make (any version really)
2. Get `deps/` submodules downloaded too

On windows you can get the compiler from [msys2](https://packages.msys2.org/package/)

Oh and yes, Visual Studio can go touch grass itself.

### Compiling library

If the mix of nodejs and python for generating secondary source files scares you, it really shouldn't, the resulting files are included in this repo, you donâ€™t have to think about it at all. I just can't decide which one to use.

`make` command will produce `liblambda.dll.a` and `lambda.dll`. Never it was simpler than that.

Don't forget to add `-lws2_32` on Windows or it will bite you in the ass.

### Compiling your project

Link `lambda.dll` and you're good to go. Oh, don't forget to include some headers, obviously.

Go see [some examples or smthng](/examples)


## A few quick notes before you start blasting

### OS support

- Any modern linux
- Windows 7+ (might actually work on 7, let me know if it does)

### Compiler version

Use GCC 10 or never. The project uses a few of the c++20 features, and it might not compile with GCC's older versions.

Other compilers are not \*officially\* supported, but there aren't any super-GCC-specific tricks employed in this project, so theoretically with some tweaking it should compile anywhere.
